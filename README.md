# S3_song_fusions
This mod aims to give you the best way of having the fusions of the final and prototype tracks made by the Mastered Realm, SilvaGunner and PoloBlue and yes the tracks are properly looped!

The songs are:

Carnival Zone Act 1 (Beta Mix)

Carnival Zone Act 2 (Beta Mix)

Ice Cap Act 1 - Sonic Origins (MJ Sound Team Remix)

Ice Cap Act 2 - Sonic Origins (MJ Sound Team Remix)

Launch Base Zone Act 1 (Hybrid Mix)

Launch Base Zone Act 2 (Hybrid Mix)


The rest of the tracks have been replaced by the S3AIR remasters in a similar way CW and Stealth did it, so say goodbye to the low-pass filter! 


Happy listening!
